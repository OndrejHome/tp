# Tiny Projects
This repository holds various files that are part of small projects I have done or find to be useful. Files are organized in directories with `YEAR-MONTH-project-name` format, indicating when the project was first started. More information can be found in directory `README` file.

In case you have found something _wrong_ and would like to fix it or point it out use the GitHub Issues or Pull Requests (PRs) ;)
